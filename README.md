# classicIwebtemplate_nolist

Description: This is a very simple movil-first webpage template. Some teachers at school have hinted that I should have some templates on hand for making web pages fast. A friend also is studying programming asked about fast ways to build web pages. I thought I would share this in the case some one wants to use it if they need a web page quickly or needs a basic html structure to study some other programming interactivity.
This page has some basic navigation links that are centered in the movil view. They then are floated to the right on wider screens to allow a for a svg logo on the left side.
